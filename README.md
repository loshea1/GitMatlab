Downloads:

Git - Version control system that is used to communicate with GitHub

GitHub Desktop (Optional) - Application that is downloaded to your computer to easily push, pull, commit, etc. to GitHub.

GitHub CLI - A command-line tool that brings pull requests, issues, GitHub actions, and other GitHub features.

Git and Github CLI are required for this toolbox to work. If any of these softwares are not downloaded, the button will be 
enabled. If it is downloaded, the button will be greyed out but still enabled (in case a re-download is needed).

When a software is downloaded, MATLAB will close down and restart.

Buttons:

If you have a repository that is remotely on GitHub and would like to add it locally, you can clone it to your computer. Make
sure you are in the path that you want to clone the repository (i.e. be in an empty folder in MATLAB).

If you need to connect MATLAB to your GitHub, you can connect with "Connect to GitHub". It will automatically open to a URL,
you need to confirm with the one-time code that is generated on the MATLAB command window. If you are already signed in, the
button will be green. Hovering over the button will tell you what account is logged in. Pressing the button again allows you
to sign in with a different account. 

If you have code that is locally on your computer, you can connect it to your GitHub account with "Link Code to GitHub". It
will ask if there are any files that you want to ignore. This means that the files will NOT be added to Github. You can select
files based on file extension or specific files in folder.
